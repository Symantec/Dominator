/*
	Package srpc is similar to the net/rpc package in the Go standard library,
	except that it provides streaming RPC access, TLS support and authentication
	and authorisation using X509 client certificates.

	Package srpc provides access to the exported methods of an object across a
	network or other I/O connection. A server registers an object, making it
	visible as a service with the name of the type of the object. After
	registration, exported methods of the object will be accessible remotely.
	A server may register multiple objects (services) of different types but it
	is an error to register multiple objects of the same type.

	The remainder of this documentation describes the protocol, to assist the
	development of implementations in other languages.

	Internally, multiple URL paths are registered with the HTTP default mux:
	  /_goSRPC_/              Unsecured (no TLS, no auth), GOB coder.
	  /_go_TLS_SRPC_/         Secured (TLS, full auth), GOB coder.
	  /_SRPC_/unsecured/JSON  Unsecured (no TLS, no auth), JSON coder.
	  /_SRPC_/TLS/JSON        Secured (TLS, full auth), JSON coder.
	Thus, a web server may also support SRPC on the same port.

	A client issues a HTTP CONNECT request to a server and (for secured
	connections) performs a TLS handshake. If the server requires the TLS
	handshake prior to the HTTP CONNECT, the client will retry with that mode.

	Once connected, a client may issue a sequence of RPC calls, one at a time
	per connection. The client sends the name of the RPC method to call,
	followed by a newline character (a carriage return+newline is permitted).
	For a secured connection, the server will verify if the client X509
	certificate is signed by a trusted CA and if the method is listed in the
	list of permitted methods in the certificate.
	If the method call is established, the server sends a newline character. If
	the method call is rejected then an error message followed by a newline is
	sent.

	The server then calls a registered method hander. The client and server can
	exchange messages using the appropriate coder (GOB is preferred, JSON is
	available as a fallback). Most method handlers wait for client messages and
	then respond. Once the method handler exits (without an error code), the
	server waits for another method call.
